## Problem Statement

AtliQ Hardware has become one of the fastest companies in the electronic goods market. While they grew substantially in the last few years, they had some bitter experiences in Latin America. They tried to establish their presence their by opening stores, but ended up suffering a huge loss because they made decisions based on their intuitions and a few surveys. In the annual strategic meeting, they decided to onboard data analytics into their company and make data-driven decisions. Previously, they have done some analysis using Excel files, but due to the companies substantial growth, analysis on Excel doesn't work for them anymore. 
AtliQ Hardware has hired a team to onboard data analytics into their company and bring transparency for accurate decision making. Their main competitor, Dell, is growing substantially and are giving a tough compeition to Dell, possibly because of their huge data analytics team who do anaylysis in customer demographic, consumtion patterns, income levels, and so on.
